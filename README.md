# Prototype Design Pattern - Journaling CLI Application

This repository contains a Node.js CLI application demonstrating the Prototype Design Pattern through a practical journaling template system. It accompanies the blog post [Mastering the Prototype Design Pattern: A Comprehensive Guide](https://www.spithacode.com/blog/prototype-design-pattern).

## Blog Post Summary

The blog post "Mastering the Prototype Design Pattern: A Comprehensive Guide" provides an in-depth exploration of the Prototype design pattern in object-oriented programming. Here are the key points covered:

- Introduction to the Prototype design pattern and its role in solving creational problems
- Detailed explanation of the pattern's structure and implementation
- Practical demonstration through building a journaling templates Node.js CLI application
- Step-by-step guide on implementing the pattern, including:
  - Creating the JournalTemplate class
  - Implementing a TemplateRegistry
  - Defining template manipulation actions (create, view, use, clone)
  - Building an interactive CLI menu

The post aims to help readers understand how to efficiently clone complex objects and implement the pattern in real-world scenarios.

## Application Overview

The CLI application in this repository implements a journaling template system where users can:
- Create new journaling templates
- Clone and modify existing templates
- View all available templates
- Use templates to create journal entries

## Features

- Template Creation: Create new journaling templates from scratch
- Template Cloning: Create new templates based on existing ones
- Template Management: View, edit, and manage your templates
- Journal Entry Creation: Use templates to write structured journal entries
- Interactive CLI: User-friendly command-line interface

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/spithacode/prototype-design-pattern-journaling-cli-app.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
